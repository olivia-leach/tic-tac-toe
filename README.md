# tic tac toe game

Project 1 for General Assembly Web Development Immersive.

## Approach

* Implement in steps
* Complete basic HTML/CSS
* Complete JS game logic
* Connect front end to API usin AJAX / jQuery
* Array to represent gameboard
* Don't let functionality suffer
* Commit early and often
* Branches:
  * maintain a master branch that works
  * feature branch --> get a feature complete & working (3-5 commits) --> merge that back in to master

## Deliverables

-   A working browser game, built by you, hosted on GitHub Pages (or an alternative platform).
-   A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
-   A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc.
-   A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
Links to wireframes and user stories, preferably in the README of your repo.

-   Be deployed online, where the rest of the world can access it
-   Render a game board in the browser
-   Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
-   Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
-   Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
-   Use AJAX for data storage and retrieval
-   Have login, logout, and change password functionality
-   Visually display the results of retrieving game information
-   Create and Update games.

In addition, you must use separate files for your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and (where possible) use semantic markup for your HTML. And in general, try to stick with KISS (Keep It Stupidly Simple) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

## Bonus

-   If allowing players to compete from separate devices, display a "Waiting..." message while users are waiting to be matched
-   Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
-   Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
-   Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
-   Add tableside chat to your game
-   Use localStorage to persist data locally, allowing games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
